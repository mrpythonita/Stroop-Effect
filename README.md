# Project: Stroop Effect with Python
-------------------------
## Introduction 

In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task; it is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first documneted the effect in 1935. In specific, naming the font color of a printed word is an easier and quicker task if word meaning and font color are congruent. If both are printed in red, the average time to say "RED" in response to the word 'Green' is greater than the time to say "RED" in response to the word 'Mouse'.

## Getting Started

There is one data-set avalilabe for this project and it is a csv file (stroppdata.csv). This project is comprised of different tasks:

* __Defining Variables__
* __Generating Descriptive Statistics__
* __Understanding Data with Data Visualizations__
* __Conducting Hypothesis Testing__
* __Statistical Analysis & Conclusion__

## Prerequisites

Python 3 is the environment utilized with the addition of the following libraries:

* __jupyter__ (+ dependencies) 

## Installing

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import math
data = pd.read_csv('stroopdata.csv')

```

## Deployment

* **ProjectPerceptualPhenomenon.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for creating/testing the core logic implemented in this project.

## _Acknowledgments_

* Chapeau to StackOverflow, GitHub, and Udacity Knowledge platforms for providing some guidance code.
